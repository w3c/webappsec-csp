  Introduction {#intro}
  ============

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Content Security Policy is a great defense against cross-site scripting
  attacks, allowing developers to harden their own sites against injection of
  malicious script, style, and other resource types. It does not, however,
  give developers the ability to apply restrictions to third-party content
  loaded in via `<iframe>`. Allowing CSP to apply directly to these third-party
  contexts would be dangerous; CSP gives quite granular control over resource
  loading, and it's very possible to introduce vulnerabilities into an otherwise
  secure page by denying it access to particular scripts. We've seen these kinds
  of issues in past features such as `X-XSS-Protection`, so we must be careful
  to avoid reintroducing them in a new form.

  That said, it would be quite useful to be able to place restrictions upon
  widgets, advertisements, and other kinds of third-party content. This document
  proposes a mechanism which relies on an explicit opt-in from the embedded
  content, which ought to make it possible for widgets to cooperate with their
  embedders to negotiate a reasonable set of restrictions.

  In short, the embedder proposes a Content Security Policy as an attribute on
  the `<iframe>` element. This policy is transmitted along with the HTTP request
  for the framed content in an `Embedding-CSP` header. If the embedded content
  can accept that policy, it may do so by returning the proposed policy in a
  `Content-Security-Policy` header along with the response.

  If the response contains a policy identical to the policy which the embedder
  requested, the user agent will render the embedded content. If no such policy
  is present, the response will be blocked.

  Examples {#examples}
  --------

  <div class="example" id="example1">
    MegaCorp Inc. wishes to ensure that the advertisements that run on its
    various publications are locked down to include script from trusted origins
    that have been audited for safety. They can do so by including the
    advertisement via an <{iframe}> element with a <{iframe/csp}> attribute:

    <pre>
      &lt;iframe src="https://advertisements-r-us.example.com/ad1.cfm"
              <a for="iframe" element-attr>csp</a>="script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/"&gt;
      &lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>

    This will generate a request to `advertisements-r-us.example.com` that has
    an <a http-header>`Embedding-CSP`</a> header, as follows:

    <pre>
      GET / HTTP/1.1
      Host: advertisements-r-us.example.com
      ...
      <a http-header>Embedding-CSP</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/
      ...
    </pre>

    The advertisement server parses this request header, decides that it's
    acceptable, and reflects it in the response:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/
    </pre>

    Since the policy asserted by the response matches the policy required by the
    request, the frame loads successfully.
  </div>

  <div class="example" id="example2">
    The advertising server in the above example wishes to ensure that no plugins
    are loaded, regardless of what its embedder requires. It can do so by
    sending a restrictive policy in addition to any policy required by an
    embedder. That is, given a request that has an
    <a http-header>`Embedding-CSP`</a> header:

    <pre>
      GET / HTTP/1.1
      Host: advertisements-r-us.example.com
      ...
      <a http-header>Embedding-CSP</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/
      ...
    </pre>

    The advertisement server parses this request header, decides that it's
    acceptable, and reflects it in the response, along with a policy that
    prevents plugin loading:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/,
                               object-src 'none'
    </pre>
    
    The "`,`" in the <a>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header's value splits the
    string into two serialized policies, each of which is enforced. The user
    agent verifies that one of the policies delivered with the response matches
    the requirement, and since additional policies can only make the
    <em>effective</em> policy for the page more restrictive, allows the frame
    to load successfully.
  </div>

  <div class="example" id="example3">
    To ease the embedee-side implementation, Advertisements-R-Us decides it can
    trust policies sent by MegaCorp, Inc. to be applied safely to its
    advertisements. It can express this assertion via the
    <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> response header. Given the scenario in
    the above examples, the following response wold be loaded successfully:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a http-header>Allow-CSP-From</a>: https://example.com/
    </pre>

    As would the wide-open response:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a http-header>Allow-CSP-From</a>: *
    </pre>
  </div>

  Framework {#framework}
  =========

  Integration with HTML {#html-integration}
  ---------------------

  1.  <{iframe}> elements have a <dfn element-attr for="iframe">csp</dfn>
      attribute which specifies the policy that an embedded document must agree
      to enforce upon itself. Valid attribute values match the
      <a grammar>serialized-policy</a> grammar from [[!CSP3]].

      <pre class="idl">
        partial interface HTMLIFrameElement {
          [CEReactions] attribute DOMString csp;
        };
      </pre>

      {{HTMLIFrameElement}}'s {{HTMLIFrameElement/csp}} IDL attribute
      <a>reflects</a> the value of the element's <{iframe/csp}> content attribute.

      ISSUE: Upstream this to all the HTMLs.

  2.  A <a>browsing context</a> has a <dfn export>required CSP</dfn>, which is
      either `null` or a <a>serialized CSP</a>. For a given <a>browsing
      context</a> (|context|), the value is the result of executing
      [[#required-csp-for-context]] on |context|.

      ISSUE: Does this need to be upstreamed? Probably not.

  3.  Add the following to the list of error conditions in step 1 of HTML's
      <a>process a navigate response</a> algorithm:

      *   The [[#process-response]] algorithm returns "`Blocked`" when executed
          upon `response`, `request`, and `browsingContext`.

      ISSUE: Upstream this to WHATWG's HTML.

      ISSUE(w3c/html#584): W3C's HTML is not based on Fetch, and does not have
      a <a>process a navigate response</a> algorithm into which to hook.

  4.  Add the following after step 5 of HTML's <a>process a navigate fetch</a>
      algorithm:

      6.  If `browsingContext`'s <a>required CSP</a> is not `null`,
          <a for="header list">append</a> a header whose name is
          "<a http-header>`Embedding-CSP`</a>" and whose value is
          `browsingContext`'s <a>required CSP</a> to `request`'s
          <a for="request">header list</a>.

      ISSUE: Upstream this to WHATWG's HTML.

      ISSUE(w3c/html#584): W3C's HTML is not based on Fetch, and does not have
      a <a>process a navigate fetch</a> algorithm into which to hook.
  
  The `Embedding-CSP` HTTP Request Header {#embedding-csp-http-header}
  ---------------------------------------

  In order to ensure that the embedded resource can decide whether or not it is
  willing to adhere to the embedder's requirements, the policy expressed in an
  <{iframe}>'s <{iframe/csp}> attribute is communicated along with some
  <a>requests</a> via an "<dfn export http-header>`Embedding-CSP`</dfn>" HTTP
  request header. The header's value is represented by the following ABNF
  [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Embedding-CSP = <a grammar>serialized-policy</a>
  </pre>

  A user agent MUST NOT send more than one HTTP response header field named
  "`Embedding-CSP`", and any such header MUST NOT contain more than one
  <a grammar>serialized-policy</a>.
  
  Servers MUST process only the first policy in the first such header received.

  The `Allow-CSP-From` HTTP Response Header {#allow-csp-from-http-header}
  -------------------------------------------

  An embedee can opt-into accepting a policy specified by an embedder by
  responding with a "<dfn export http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</dfn>" HTTP
  response header. The header's value is represented by the following ABNF
  [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Allow-CSP-From = <a grammar>origin-or-null</a> / <a grammar>wildcard</a>
  </pre>

  Policy Subsumption {#policy-subsumption}
  ------------------

  If an embedee does not wish to accept any <a>policy</a> specified by its 
  embedder via the <a http-header>Allow-CSP-From</a> header, it can deliver a
  <a>policy</a> that is as strict, or stricter than the policy requested in the
  <a http-header>Embedding-CSP</a> header. That is, if the embedder requests 
  `object-src https://cdn.example.com/`, the embedee can respond with 
  `object-src 'none'`. Because every possible <a>request</a> blocked by 
  `object-src https://cdn.example.com/` would also be blocked by 
  `object-src 'none'`, it is said that the embedder's required <a>policy</a> 
  <dfn>subsumes</dfn> the <a>policy</a> delivered by the embedee.

  Given the complexity of CSP's syntax, subsumption is not trivial to calculate.
  The details are spelled out in [[#subsume-policy].

  <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

  <h3 id="process-response" algorithm>
    Is |response| to |request| blocked by |context|'s required CSP?
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), a <a>request</a> (|request|), and a
  <a>browsing context</a> (|context|), this algorithm returns "`Allowed`" or
  "`Blocked`" as appropriate:

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Return "`Allowed`" if either of the following is true:
    
        1.  |context| is not a <a>nested browsing context</a>.

        2.  |context|'s <a>required CSP</a> is `null`.

    2.  Let |embedding policy| be the result of executing
        [[csp3#parse-serialized-policy]] on |context|'s <a>required CSP</a> and
        "`enforce`".

    3.  If the [[#origin-allowed]] algorithm returns "`Allowed`" when executed upon
        |response| and |request|:

        1.  Append |embedding policy| to |response|'s <a for="response">CSP
            list</a>.

        2.  Return "`Allowed`".

    4.  Assert: |context| is a <a>nested browsing context</a>, and |response| is
        a cross-origin, <a>network schemed</a> resource.

    5.  If the [[#subsume-policy]] algorithm returns "`Subsumed`" when executed
        upon |response|'s <a for="response">CSP list</a> and |embedding policy|,
        return "`Allowed`".

    6.  Return "`Blocked`".
  </ol>

  <h3 id="origin-allowed" algorithm>
    Does |response| allow blanket enforcment of policy from |request|?
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), and a <a>request</a> (|request|), this
  algorithm returns "`Allowed`" if the former allows the latter to enforce
  arbitrary policy, and "`Not Allowed`" otherwise:


  1.  If |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s <a for="url">scheme</a> is
      a <a>local scheme</a>, return "`Allowed`".

      Note: The embedder has direct access to same-origin responses, so if it
      wishes to enforce a policy on that same-origin response, we simply do so.
      
  2.  If |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s <a for="url">origin</a> is the
      same as |request|'s <a for="request">origin</a>, return "`Allowed`".

      Note: Likewise, <a>local scheme</a> responses already inherit their policy
      from the embedder, so we allow the embedder to tighten that policy via this
      embedding mechanism.

  3.  If |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a> has a header named
      <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> (|header|):

      1.  If |header|'s value is "`*`", return "`Allowed`".

      2.  If |request|'s <a for="request">origin</a>,
          <a lt="ASCII serialization of an origin">serialized</a> and <a>UTF-8
          encoded</a> is |header|'s value, return "`Allowed`".

  4.  Return "`Not Allowed`".

  <h3 id="subsume-policy" algorithm>
    Is |policy list| subsumed under |subsuming policy|?
  </h3>

  Given a list of <a>policy</a> objects (|policy list|), this algorithm returns
  "`Subsumed`" if that list enforces a <a>policy</a> which is an exact match for
  a given <a>policy</a> object (|subsuming policy|). It returns "`Not Subsumed`"
  otherwise.

  Note: Ideally, we'll someday define a real subsumption algorithm
  which would verify that the policy `default-src 'none'; script-src
  https://example.com` is subsumbed under `default-src example.com` (as
  there is no case in which the latter will block a request that the former
  would allow). That calculation turns out to be hard, so the current algorithm
  takes the significantly simpler approach of requiring an exact match.

  Note: This is not an efficient algorithm. Implementers are encouraged to
  implement something a little smarter and faster, with the same behavior.

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  If |subsuming policy| is `null`, return "`Subsumed`".

    2.  For each |policy| in |policy list|:

        1.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is not
            "`enforce`", set skip to the next |policy|.

        2.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> is not the
            same size as |subsuming policy|'s <a for="policy">directive
            set</a>, skip to the next |policy|.

        3.  For each |directive| in |policy|'s
            <a for="policy">directive set</a>:

            1.  Let |subsuming directive| be the <a>directive</a> in
                |subsuming policy|'s <a for="policy">directive
                set</a> whose <a for="directive">name</a> matches
                |directive|'s <a for="directive">name</a>, or `null`
                if no such <a>directive</a> is present.

            2.  If |subsuming directive| is `null`, skip to the next
                |policy|.

            3.  If |subsuming directive|'s <a for="directive">value</a>
                list is not the same size as |directive|'s
                <a for="directive">value</a> list, skip to the next
                |policy|.

            4.  For each |token| in |directive|'s
                <a for="directive">value</a>:

                1.  If |token| is not present in |subsuming
                    directive|'s <a for="directive">value</a>, skip to the
                    next |policy|.

        4.  Return "`Subsumed`".

    3.  Return "`Not Subsumed`".

  Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy-considerations}
  =================================== 

  Policy Enforcement {#policy-enforcement}
  ------------------

  Embedded documents should be careful to evaluate the proposed Content Security
  Policy, and not simply to reflect whatever policy an embedder suggests. Doing
  so may enable a clever attacker to selectively disable pieces of a website's
  code which are essential for its own protection.

  In particular, documents which do not expect to be embedded should continue to
  respond to any such request with a Content Security Policy containing an
  appropriate <a>`frame-ancestors`</a> directive.

  Policy Leakage {#policy-leakage}
  --------------

  The enforcement mechanism allows a malicious embedder to read a page's policy
  cross-origin by brute-forcing its constraints. This could leak interesting
  data about the page or the user loading the page if the policy contains secret
  tokens or usernames.

  Again, the best defense here is to control the contexts allowed to embed a
  given resource via an appropriate <a>`frame-ancestors`</a> directive.

  Data Exfiltration {#exfiltration}
  -----------------

  This feature allows an embedder to send information to a third-party endpoint
  via the <a http-header>`Embedding-CSP`</a> HTTP header. This doesn't seem to
  expose any information that couldn't be tunneled in the HTTP request itself
  (via GET parameters, etc), and embedders remain in control over the endpoints
  to which such requests may be made by enforcing a Content Security Policy with
  an appropriate `child-src` directive.

<section>
  IANA Considerations {#iana}
  ===================

  The permanent message header field registry should be updated
  with the following registration for the
  <a http-header>`Embedding-CSP`</a> header: [[!RFC3864]]

  :   Header field name
  ::  Embedding-CSP

  ::  http
  :   Status
  ::  standard
  :   Author/Change controller

  Likewise, the registry should be updated with the following registration
  for the <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> header: [[!RFC3864]]
