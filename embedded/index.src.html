  Introduction {#intro}
  ============

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Content Security Policy is a great defense against cross-site scripting
  attacks, allowing developers to harden their own sites against injection of
  malicious script, style, and other resource types. It does not, however,
  give developers the ability to apply restrictions to third-party content
  loaded in via <{iframe}>. Allowing CSP to apply directly to these third-party
  contexts would be dangerous; CSP gives quite granular control over resource
  loading, and it's very possible to introduce vulnerabilities into an otherwise
  secure page by denying it access to particular scripts. We've seen these kinds
  of issues in past features such as `X-XSS-Protection`, so we must be careful
  to avoid reintroducing them in a new form.

  That said, it would be quite useful to be able to place restrictions upon
  widgets, advertisements, and other kinds of third-party content. This document
  proposes a mechanism which relies on an explicit opt-in from the embedded
  content, which ought to make it possible for widgets to cooperate with their
  embedders to negotiate a reasonable set of restrictions.

  In short, the embedder proposes a Content Security Policy by setting an attribute on an <{iframe}>
  element. This policy is transmitted along with the HTTP request for the framed content in an
  HTTP request header (<a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a>). If the embedded content can accept that
  policy, it can enforce it by returning a <a http-header>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> or
  <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> header along with the response.

  If the response contains a policy at least as strict as the policy which the embedder requested,
  or accepts the embedder-provided policy, then the user agent will render the embedded content. If
  no such assertion is present, the response will be blocked.

  Examples {#examples}
  --------

  <div class="example" id="example1">
    MegaCorp Inc. wishes to ensure that the advertisements that run on its
    various publications are locked down to include script from trusted origins
    that have been audited for safety. They can do so by including the
    advertisement via an <{iframe}> element with a <{iframe/csp}> attribute:

    <pre>
      &lt;iframe src="https://advertisements-r-us.example.com/ad1.cfm"
              <a for="iframe" element-attr>csp</a>="script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/"&gt;
      &lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>

    This will generate a request to `advertisements-r-us.example.com` that has
    a <a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a> header, as follows:

    <pre>
      GET / HTTP/1.1
      Host: advertisements-r-us.example.com
      ...
      <a http-header>Sec-Required-CSP</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/
      ...
    </pre>

    The advertisement server parses this request header, decides that it's acceptable, and adds a
    header to the response, informing the user agent that it will adhere to the restrictions imposed
    by its embedder (`https://example.com`):

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a http-header>Allow-CSP-From</a>: https://example.com
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example" id="example2">
    The advertisement server in the example above could also accept the restrictions by emitting its
    own  <a http-header>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header that's at least as strong as the policy
    which the embedder requires. For example, it might wish to ensure that no plugins are loaded,
    regardless of what the embedder allows. It can do so by emitting a policy that includes the
    embedder's restrictions, and adds more on top:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a http-header>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/; object-src 'none'
    </pre>

    Since the policy asserted by the response allows strictly fewer requests than the policy
    required by the request, the frame loads successfully.

    Note that the server could also deliver two policies, one which mirrors the restrictions of the
    embedder exactly, another which tightens them:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a http-header>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src https://trusted-cdn.example.com/, object-src 'none'
    </pre>
    
    The "`,`" in the <a http-header>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header's value splits the
    string into two serialized policies, each of which is enforced. The user
    agent verifies that one of the policies delivered with the response matches
    the requirement, and since additional policies can only make the
    <em>effective</em> policy for the page more restrictive, allows the frame
    to load successfully.
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  Framework {#framework}
  =========

  At a high level, this document describes a mechanism by which an embedee can opt-into a set of
  restrictions specified by its embedder. The mechanism involves a few steps:

  1.  The embedder specifies a required policy via a <{iframe/csp}> attribute on an <{iframe}>
      element. This is described in more detail in [[#csp-attribute]].
      
  2.  That attribute's value will be sent along with any <a>navigation request</a> that targets
      the <{iframe}>'s <a>nested browsing context</a> in a <a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a>
      HTTP request header. This header is described in more detail in [[#required-csp-header]].

  3.  The server can examine the <a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a> header to determine whether
      it wishes to accept the required policy.If so, it can implicitly opt-in by sending a
      <a http-header>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header in the response that contains a policy
      which is at least as strong as the required policy, or explicitly opt-in by sending an
      <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> header in the response that enables the embedding origin
      to set whatever policy it wishes. The explicit mechanism is straightforward, described in
      [[#allow-csp-from-header]]. The implicit mechanism is quite complicated, and comprises the
      entire [[#implicit-opt-in]] section.

      If the server doesn't wish to accept the required policy, it can return an explicit error,
      or simply return the usual data without either a matching
      <a http-header>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header or an <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a>
      header. In this case, the user agent will block the response. This integration with HTML's
      <a>navigate</a> algorithm is described in [[#html-integration]], and the blocking mechanism
      is spelled out in [[#process-response]].

  `<iframe>`'s `csp` attribute {#csp-attribute}
  ----------------------------
  
  <{iframe}> elements have a <dfn element-attr for="iframe">csp</dfn> attribute, which specifies
  the policy that an embedded document must agree to enforce upon itself. For example, the following
  HTML would load `https://embedee.example.com/`, and ensure that `object-src 'none'` was enforced
  upon it:

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      &lt;iframe src="https://embedee.example.com/" <a for="iframe" element-attr>csp</a>="object-src 'none'"&gt;
      &lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  A <a>string</a> (|value|) is a <dfn for="iframe/csp">valid attribute value</dfn> for a given
  <a>element</a> (|element|)'s <{iframe/csp}> <a>content attribute</a> if all of the
  following statements are true:

  1.  |value| is not the empty string.

  2.  |value| matches the <a grammar>serialized-policy</a> ABNF grammar defined in [[!CSP]].

  3.  |element|'s <a>node document</a>'s <a for="Document">browsing context</a>'s
      <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a> is `null`, or the result of
      <a lt="parse a serialized csp as disposition">parsing |value| as "`enforce`"</a> is
      <a for="policy">subsumed by</a> |element|'s <a>node document</a>'s <a for="Document">browsing
      context</a>'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a>.

  <div class="example">
    The following strings are valid values for the <{iframe/csp}> attribute, as they're valid CSP
    grammar:

    *   `script-src 'none'`
    *   `script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; sandbox`
    *   `not-a-directive https://whatever.not-a-tld`

    Note: We consider the last item valid even though it doesn't express a meaningful policy in
    order to remain forward-compatible with future CSP syntax.

    The following, on the other hand, do not match the CSP syntax, and would not be considered valid
    attribute values:

    *  `script-src *\nInjected-Header: XSS!`
    *  `💩`

    Note: We need to be careful about the values we allow in the <{iframe/csp}> attribute, as its
    contents will end up reflected as an HTTP request header. This concern is discussed in a little
    more detail in [[#header-injection]].
  </div>

  <{iframe}>'s <{iframe/csp}> <a>content attribute</a> has a corresponding IDL attribute, defined
  by the following WebIDL grammar [[!WEBIDL]]:

  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface HTMLIFrameElement {
      [CEReactions] attribute DOMString csp;
    };
  </pre>

  The {{HTMLIFrameElement/csp}} IDL attribute must [=reflect=] the element's <{iframe/csp}>
  [=content attribute=].

  ISSUE: Upstream this to all the HTMLs.
 
  The `Sec-Required-CSP` HTTP Request Header {#required-csp-header}
  ---------------------------------------

  In order to ensure that the embedded resource can decide whether or not it is willing to adhere to
  the embedder's requirements, the policy expressed in an <{iframe}>'s <{iframe/csp}> attribute is
  communicated along with affected <a>navigation requests</a> via a
  "<dfn export http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</dfn>" HTTP request header. The header's value is
  represented by the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Sec-Required-CSP = <a grammar>serialized-policy</a>
  </pre>

  A user agent MUST NOT send more than one HTTP response header field named "`Sec-Required-CSP`", and
  any such header MUST NOT contain more than one <a grammar>serialized-policy</a>.
  
  Servers MUST process only the first policy in the first such header received. As discussed in
  [[#header-reflection]], servers SHOULD also carefully consider the implications of simply
  reflecting a policy back to a client. If the server wishes to simply accept an embedder's
  requirements, the <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> header is a safer choice.

  This header is set as part of HTML's <a>navigate</a> algorithm (see [[#html-integration]] for
  details on the hook that calls the following algorithm):

  <div algorithm="set a request's required-csp header">
    To <dfn abstract-op local-lt="set-required-csp">set the `Sec-Required-CSP` header</dfn> for a
    given <a>request</a> (|request|), run the following steps:

    1.  If |request| is not a <a>navigation request</a>, return.

    2.  Let |requirement| be |request|'s <a for="request">client</a>'s
        <a for="environment settings object">responsible browsing context</a>'s
        <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a>.

    3.  If |requirement| is `null`, return.

    4.  Assert: |requirement| is a <a>serialized CSP</a>, matching the
        <a grammar>serialized-policy</a> grammar defined in [[!CSP]].

    5.  <a for="header list">Append</a> a header named "<a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a>" with a
        value of |requirement| to |request|'s <a for="request">header list</a>.
  </div>

  The `Allow-CSP-From` HTTP Response Header {#allow-csp-from-header}
  -------------------------------------------

  An embedee can opt-into accepting a policy specified by an embedder by responding with a
  "<dfn export http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</dfn>" HTTP response header. The header's value is
  represented by the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Allow-CSP-From = <a grammar>origin-or-null</a> / <a grammar>wildcard</a>
  </pre>

  Integration with HTML {#html-integration}
  ---------------------

  1.  <{iframe}> elements have a <{iframe/csp}> attribute, defined in [[#csp-attribute]].

  2.  Each <a>browsing context</a> has a <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a>, defined in
      [[#required-csp]].

  3.  Add the following after step 10 of HTML's <a>navigate</a> algorithm:
      
      11. <a lt="set the required CSP" abstract-op>Set</a> `browsingContext`'s
          <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a>.

      ISSUE: Upstream this to WHATWG's HTML.

      ISSUE(w3c/html#584): W3C's HTML's navigation algorithm is wildly divergent from WHATWG's at
      this point. Upstream something to that document once things are reconciled.

  4.  Add the following to the list of error conditions in step 1 of HTML's
      <a>process a navigate response</a> algorithm:

      *   The [[#process-response]] algorithm returns "`Blocked`" when executed
          upon `response`, `request`, and `browsingContext`.

      ISSUE: Upstream this to WHATWG's HTML.

      ISSUE(w3c/html#584): W3C's HTML is not based on Fetch, and does not have
      a <a>process a navigate response</a> algorithm into which to hook.

  5.  Add the following after step 5 of HTML's <a>process a navigate fetch</a>
      algorithm:

      6.  <a lt="set-required-csp" abstract-op>Set</a> `request`'s
          "<a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a>" header.

      ISSUE: Upstream this to WHATWG's HTML.

      ISSUE(w3c/html#584): W3C's HTML is not based on Fetch, and does not have
      a <a>process a navigate fetch</a> algorithm into which to hook.

  ### Browsing Context's Required CSP ### {#required-csp}

  Each <a>browsing context</a> has a <dfn for="browsing context">required CSP</dfn>, which is either
  `null` or a <a>serialized CSP</a>. The value is set during the <a>navigate</a> algorithm, and will
  not change until the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a> changes.

  The following algorithm will execute at around step 10 of the current <a>navigate</a> algorithm:

  <div algorithm="browsing context's required CSP">
    To <dfn abstract-op>set the required CSP</dfn> for a given <a>browsing context</a> (|context|),
    run the following steps:
    
    1.  If |context| is a <a>nested browsing context</a>:

        1.  If |context|'s <a>browsing context container</a> has an <{iframe/csp}> <a>content
            attribute</a> with a <a for="iframe/csp">valid attribute value</a> (|value|), set
            |context|'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a> to |value| and return.

        2.  Set |context|'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a> to the value of |context|'s
            <a>parent browsing context</a>'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a>.

    2.  Set |context|'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a> to `null`.
  </div>

  Implicit Policy Acceptance {#implicit-opt-in}
  ==========================

  An embedee can explicitly accept a policy requirement specified by its embedder by returning an
  <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> header along with a response. The requirement can also be
  implicitly accepted by delivering a <a http-header>`Content-Security-Policy`</a> header that
  contains a policy (or set of policies) whose net effect is at least as strict as the policy
  required by the embedder.

  "At least as strict", however, isn't very precise. Simple cases are straightforward: if an
  embedder requires `object-src https://cdn.example.com`, the embedee can respond with `object-src
  'none'`. Since every possible resource that would be blocked by the former would also be blocked
  by the latter (because it allows no objects at all), we wouldn't block the embedding. CSP's
  syntactical complexity makes this a little bit difficult to reason about for more complicated
  cases. For instance, given `script-src 'unsafe-inline' http: 'sha256-abc...def'`, it might appear
  that `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` would be a subset of the required policy. The presence of the
  <a grammar>hash-source</a> expression, however means that `'unsafe-inline'` is ignored in the
  required policy, so the latter policy would actually allow more than the former, despite
  appearances.

  To formalize the concept a bit, we need a few terms, and more than a few algorithms:

  *   A <a>policy</a> (|A|) is said to <dfn for="policy" export>subsume</dfn> another <a>policy</a>
      (|B|) if |B| is at least as strict as |A|. In this case |B| could also be said to be
      <dfn for="policy" export>subsumed by</dfn> |A|. The details of determining "at least as
      strict"ness are spelled out in [[#subsumption]].

  *   When multiple policies are present, they have a combined effect which is described in
      [[CSP3#multiple-policies|"The effect of multiple policies"]]. Here, we'll talk about the
      combined effect of a [=/CSP list=] as their [=CSP list/intersection=]. The details of
      determining that are spelled out in [[#intersection]].

  *   A <a>policy</a> (|A|) is said to <a>subsume</a> a [=/CSP list=] if |A| <a>subsumes</a> their
      [=CSP list/intersection=].

  Intersection {#intersection}
  ------------

  <h4 algorithm id="intersection-policy-list">CSP List intersection</h4>

  The <dfn export for="CSP list">intersection</dfn> of a [=/CSP list=] (|list|) for an [=/origin=]
  (|origin|) is a single [=Content Security Policy object=] representing their net effect,
  produced by the following algorithm:

  Note: It isn't always possible to represent the [=CSP list/intersection=] of multiple policies as
  a single policy. Consider `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` and `script-src 'nonce-abc'`, for instance:
  the former allows only inline script, the latter allows only inline or externalized script with a
  particular token. The net effect (only inline script with a particular token) cannot be created
  with a single policy. Dealing with such policies is, for the moment, left as an exercise for the
  reader.

  ISSUE: We shouldn't make the reader do this exercise.

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Let |result| be a <a for="/">policy</a> object with an empty <a>directive set</a>
        and a disposition of "`enforce`".

    2.  For each |policy| in |list|:

        1.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is "`report`",
            <a for="iteration">continue</a>.

        2.  Set |result| to the [=content security policy object/intersection=] of |result|
            and |policy| for |origin|.

    3.  Return |result|.
  </ol>

  <div class="example">

  ### Policy Intersection ### {#intersection-policy}

  The <dfn for="content security policy object">intersection</dfn> of two [=Content Security Policy

            ISSUE: We need to extend this definition to handle things that are not source lists.
            Also, we should be more precise about this, perhaps by defining a term like "source list
            directive" that we could check against |directive name|.

  ### Source List Intersection ### {#intersection-source-list}

  The <dfn for="source list">intersection</dfn> of two [=source lists=] for a
  [=directive/name|directive name=] (|name|) and an [=/origin=] (|origin|) is a [=source list=]
  representing their net effect. If no such [=source list=] exists (for example,
  `https://example.com/` in |A| and `https://not-example.com` in |B|), then the intersection will
  be the list « <a grammar>'none'</a> ».

  <ol class="algorithm">

    3.  If either |effective A| or |effective B| is « <a grammar>`'none'`</a> »,

    4.  If |effective A| is empty, return |effective B|.

    7.  Let |intersection| be an empty <a>source list</a>.

    8.  For each |expression B| in |effective B|:

            Note: Getting the <a>effective source list</a> above means that tokens matching the

            "`http:`"/"`ws:`" never appears without "`https:`"/"`ws:`" also appearing.

    9.   For each |expression| in |schemes|:

                    and the result of executing

  </ol>

  <div class="example">
    In these cases, `intersection` is an 
    <a for="source expression">intersection</a> for |A| and |B|.
      
    <pre>
      A = wss: http://example.com
      B = https: wss: 'none'
      intersection = wss: https://example.com
    </pre>

    The expression "wss:" is present in both policies, so it is present in
    their intersection. Similarly, "http://example.com" is present in the
    intersection because it is the only expression subsumed by both
    "http://example.com" and "https:". Note that "'none'"" is ignored, as it is
    not the only token in |B|.

    <pre>
      A = http://*.a.com http://*.b.com
      B = https://a.com:* http://*.c.com
      intersection = https://a.com
    </pre>

    Only two sources are similar: "http://*.a.com" in |A| is similar to 
    "https://a.com:*" in |B| so the intersection of the two source lists is
    "https://a.com".

    <pre>
      A = 'unsafe-inline' http://example.com:443/page1/html 'nonce-abc'
      B = 'unsafe-inline' https://example.com:443/ 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-abc'
      intersection = 'nonce-abc'
    </pre>

    Since "`strict-dynamic`" honors only <a grammar>`nonce-source`</a> and
    <a grammar>`hash-source`</a> expressions, |B| is effectively 
    "'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-abc'". That is why the intersection is 
    "'nonce-abc'".

  Note: This property is symmetric. That is if |A| is <a>source-expression similar</a> to |B|,

        2.  At most one of |A| and |B| has a <a for="source expression">wildcard host</a>, |host A|
            does not <a>`host-part` match</a> |host B|, and |host B| does not <a>`host-part`
            match</a> |host A|.

        3.  Neither |A| nor |B| has a <a for="source expression">wildcard port</a>, |port A|
            does not <a>`port-part` match</a> |port B|, and |port B| does not <a>`port-part`
            match</a> |port A|.

        4.  |path A| does not <a>`path-part` match</a> |path B|, and |path B| does not
            <a>`path-part` match</a> |path A|.

    13. Return "`Similar`".

      B = 'nonce-ch4hvvbHDpv7xCSvXCs3BrNggHdTzxUA'
    </pre>

    Since both |A| and |B| match the <a grammar>`nonce-source`</a> grammar and |A|
    is a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for |B|, |A| is similar to |B|.

    <pre>
      A = https://inner.example.com/foo/
      B = http://*.example.com/foo/bar/
    </pre>

    Since |A| has a <a for="source expression">wildcard host</a>, it matches any
    subdomain which in this case is "inner" so that |A| is similar to |B|.

    <pre>
      A = http://*.example.com
      B = https://example.com:*
    </pre>

    Even though |A| and |B|'s ports are different, |A| and |B| are similar 
    because "http" matches both "http" and a more secure variant "https".

    <pre>
      A = http://example.com:80/page1/html
      B = https://example.com:443/
    </pre>

    In both sources specified ports are defalt ports for the respective schemes
    and |B|'s path would match any path, |A| is similar to |B|.

    <pre>
      A = 'sha256-abc123'
      B = 'sha512-cde456'
    </pre>

    Even though both |A| and |B| match the <a grammar>`hash-source`</a> grammar, |A|
    is not a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for |B| because the hashes don't match.

    <pre>
      A = http://example.com:80
      B = http://example.com:334
    </pre>

    In this case, ports of |A| and |B| do not match so that the two sources are
    not similar .

    <pre>
      A = http://example.com/page.html
      B = http://example.com/index.html
    </pre>

    The two sources are not similar because their paths do not match.

  <h3 id="process-response" algorithm>
    Is |response| to |request| blocked by |context|'s required CSP?
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), a <a>request</a> (|request|), and a
  <a>browsing context</a> (|context|), this algorithm returns "`Allowed`" or
  "`Blocked`" as appropriate:

  <ol class="algorithm">
    1.  Return "`Allowed`" if either of the following is true:
    
        1.  |context| is not a <a>nested browsing context</a>.

        2.  |context|'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a> is `null`.

    2.  Let |required policy| be the result of executing
        [[csp3#parse-serialized-policy]] on |context|'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a> and
        "`enforce`".

    3.  If the [[#origin-allowed]] algorithm returns "`Allowed`" when executed upon
        |response| and |request|:

        1.  Append |required policy| to |response|'s <a for="response">CSP
            list</a>.

        2.  Return "`Allowed`".

    4.  Assert: |context| is a <a>nested browsing context</a>, and |response| is
        a cross-origin, <a>network schemed</a> resource.

    5.  If the [[#subsume-policy-list]] algorithm returns "`Subsumes`" when
        executed upon |required policy|, |request|'s <a for="request">origin</a>,
        |response|'s <a for="response">CSP list</a>, and |response|'s
        <a for="response">url</a>'s <a for="url">origin</a>, return "`Allowed`".

    6.  Return "`Blocked`".

  <h3 id="origin-allowed" algorithm>
    Does |response| allow blanket enforcment of policy from |request|?
  </h3>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), and a <a>request</a> (|request|), this
  algorithm returns "`Allowed`" if the former allows the latter to enforce
  arbitrary policy, and "`Not Allowed`" otherwise:


  1.  If |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s <a for="url">scheme</a> is
      a <a>local scheme</a>, return "`Allowed`".

      Note: The embedder has direct access to same-origin responses, so if it
      wishes to enforce a policy on that same-origin response, we simply do so.
      
  2.  If |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s <a for="url">origin</a> is the
      same as |request|'s <a for="request">origin</a>, return "`Allowed`".

      Note: Likewise, <a>local scheme</a> responses already inherit their policy
      from the embedder, so we allow the embedder to tighten that policy via this
      embedding mechanism.

  3.  If |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a> has a header named
      <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> (|header|):

      1.  If |header|'s value is "`*`", return "`Allowed`".

      2.  If |request|'s <a for="request">origin</a>,
          <a lt="ASCII serialization of an origin">serialized</a> and <a>UTF-8
          encoded</a> is |header|'s value, return "`Allowed`".

  4.  Return "`Not Allowed`".

  Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy-considerations}
  =================================== 

  Policy Enforcement {#policy-enforcement}
  ------------------

  Embedded documents should be careful to evaluate the proposed Content Security
  Policy, and not simply to reflect whatever policy an embedder suggests. Doing
  so may enable a clever attacker to selectively disable pieces of a website's
  code which are essential for its own protection.

  In particular, documents which do not expect to be embedded should continue to
  respond to any such request with a Content Security Policy containing an
  appropriate <a>`frame-ancestors`</a> directive.

  Policy Leakage {#policy-leakage}
  --------------

  The enforcement mechanism allows a malicious embedder to read a page's policy
  cross-origin by brute-forcing its constraints. This could leak interesting
  data about the page or the user loading the page if the policy contains secret
  tokens or usernames.

  Again, the best defense here is to control the contexts allowed to embed a
  given resource via an appropriate <a>`frame-ancestors`</a> directive.

  Data Exfiltration {#exfiltration}
  -----------------

  This feature allows an embedder to send information to a third-party endpoint
  via the <a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a> HTTP header. This doesn't seem to
  expose any information that couldn't be tunneled in the HTTP request itself
  (via GET parameters, etc), and embedders remain in control over the endpoints
  to which such requests may be made by enforcing a Content Security Policy with
  an appropriate `child-src` directive.

  Header Injection {#header-injection}
  ----------------

  <h2 id="authoring-considerations">Authoring Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="effect-self">
    Requiring `'self'`
  </h3>

  When processing a <a>browsing context</a>'s <a for="browsing context">required CSP</a>, the
  keyword <a grammar>`'self'`</a> refers to the <a for="/">origin</a> of the URL being loaded
  into the <a>nested browsing context</a>, not to the origin of the document in the <a>source
  browsing context</a>.

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. requires a policy containing <a grammar>`'self'`</a> on their page at
    `https://example.com/page.html`:

    <pre>
      &lt;iframe src="https://advertisements-r-us.example.com/ad1.cfm"
              <a for="iframe" element-attr>csp</a>="script-src 'self'"&gt;
      &lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>

    If the returned CSP is:
    <pre>
     Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
    </pre>

    Then this <{iframe}> element will be loaded. 

    If, however, the returned CSP is:
    <pre>
     Content-Security-Policy: script-src "https://example.com/"
    </pre>

    Then this <{iframe}> element will not be loaded.

  IANA Considerations {#iana}
  ===================

  The permanent message header field registry should be updated
  with the following registration for the
  <a http-header>`Sec-Required-CSP`</a> header: [[!RFC3864]]

  :   Header field name
  ::  Sec-Required-CSP
  :   Applicable protocol
  ::  http
  :   Status
  ::  standard
  :   Author/Change controller
  ::  W3C
  :   Specification document
  ::  This specification (See [[#required-csp-header]])

  Likewise, the registry should be updated with the following registration
  for the <a http-header>`Allow-CSP-From`</a> header: [[!RFC3864]]

  :   Header field name
  ::  Allow-CSP-From
  :   Applicable protocol
  ::  http
  :   Status
  ::  standard
  :   Author/Change controller
  ::  W3C
  :   Specification document
  ::  This specification (See [[#allow-csp-from-header]])
