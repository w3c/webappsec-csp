  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  [INTRODUCTION GOES HERE]


  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-basic">Control Execution</h4>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc's developers want to protect themselves against cross-site
    scripting attacks. They can mitigate the risk of script injection by
    ensuring that their trusted CDN is the only origin from which script can
    load and execute. Moreover, they wish to ensure that no plugins can
    execute in their pages' contexts. The following policy has that effect:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://cdn.example.com/scripts/; object-src 'none'
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  Content Security Policy aims to do to a few related things:

  1.  Mitigate the risk of content-injection attacks by giving developers
      fairly granular control over

      *   The resources which can be requested (and subsequently embedded or
          executed) on behalf of a specific {{Document}} or {{Worker}}

      *   The execution of inline script

      *   Dynamic code execution (via {{eval()}} and similar constructs)

      *   The application of inline style

  2.  Mitigate the risk of attacks which require a resource to be embedded
      in a malicious context ("Pixel Perfect", etc) by giving developers
      granular control over the origins which can embed a given resource.

  3.  Provide a policy framework which allows developers to tweak
      security-relevant settings.

  4.  Provide a reporting mechanism which allows developers to detect flaws
      being exploited in the wild.

  <h3 id="changes-from-level-2">Changes from Level 2</h3>

  This document describes an evolution of the Content Security Policy Level 2
  specification [[CSP2]]. The following is a high-level overview of the changes:

  1.  The specification has been rewritten from the ground up in terms of the
      [[FETCH]] specification, which should make it simpler to integrate CSP's
      requirements and restrictions with other specifications (and with
      Service Workers in particular).

  2.  The `frame-src` directive, which was deprecated in CSP Level
      2, has been removed.

  3.  Insecure schemes in source expressions now match their secure variants.
      That is, `http:` is equivalent to `http: https:`, and `http://a.com`
      to `http://a.com https://a.com`.

      Likewise, `'self'` now matches `https` and `wss` variants of the page's
      origin, even on pages whose scheme is `http`.

  <h3 id="open-questions">Open Questions</h3>

  1.  Do we really want to remove `frame-src`? Though the threat model of
      workers and frames is similar, they have distinct capabilities. Perhaps
      it makes sense for folks to allow workers while disallowing frames, or
      vice-versa?

  2.  Can we enable `sandbox` inside <{meta}>? It's not clear what threat we're
      preventing by dropping support for it (and Chrome and Safari support it
      today).

  3.  Reporting:
      
      1.  Do we still need to strip values? I think we've removed much of the
          risk by using the original URL of a blocked resource; there shouldn't
          be anything in the report JSON that script can't gather on its own by
          walking the DOM.

      2.  Sketching out a reporting framework at <a href="http://mikewest.github.io/error-reporting/">http://mikewest.github.io/error-reporting/</a>
          that we should probably use to resolve some of the issues with
          reporting in CSP2.

  <h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

  <h3 id="framework-policy">Policies</h3>

  A <dfn local-lt="policies" export>policy</dfn> defines a set of allowed and
  restricted behaviors, and may be applied to a {{Window}} or
  {{WorkerGlobalScope}} as described in [[#initialise-global-object-csp]].
  
  Each policy has an associated <dfn for="policy">directive set</dfn>, which
  is a set of <a>directives</a> that define the policy's implications when
  applied.

  Each policy has an associated <dfn for="policy">disposition</dfn>, which is
  one of `null`, "`enforce`", or "`report`". The value is `null` unless
  otherwise specified.

  A <dfn export>serialized policy</dfn> is an ASCII string, consisting of a
  semicolon-delimited series of <a>serialized directives</a>, adhering to the
  following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:
 
  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    <dfn>serialized-policy</dfn> = <a>serialized-directive</a> *( <a>OWS</a> ";" [ <a>OWS</a> <a>serialized-directive</a> ] )
                        ; <a>OWS</a> is defined in section 3.2.3 of RFC 7230
  </pre>

  <h4 id="parse-serialized-policy" dfn lt="parse a serialized policy" algorithm>
    Parse a |serialized policy|
  </h4>

  Given a <a>serialized policy</a> (|serialized policy|), this
  algorithm will return a <a>policy</a> object. If the string cannot be parsed,
  the resulting <a>policy</a>'s <a>directive set</a> will be empty.

  1.  Let |policy| be a new <a>policy</a> with an empty <a>directive
      set</a>, and a `null` <a>type</a>.

  2.  For each |token| returned by
      <a lt="strictly split a string">strictly splitting</a> |serialized
      policy| on the U+003B SEMICOLON character (`;`):

      1.  <a>Strip leading and trailing whitespace</a> from |token|.

      2.  If |token| is an empty string, skip the remaining substeps
          and continue to the next item.

      3.  Let |directive name| be the result of
          <a lt="collect a sequence of characters">collecting a sequence of
          characters</a> from |token| which are not <a>space
          characters</a>.

      4.  If |policy|'s <a>directive set</a> contains a
          <a>directive</a> whose <a for="directive">name</a> is |directive
          name|, skip the remaining substeps and continue to the next item.

          The user agent SHOULD notify developers that a directive was ignored.
          A console warning might be appropriate, for example.

      5.  Let |directive value| be the result of
          <a lt="split a string on spaces">splitting |token| on
          spaces</a>.

      6.  Let |directive| be a new <a>directive</a> whose
          <a for="directive">name</a> is |directive name|, and
          <a for="directive">value</a> is |directive value|.

      7.  Add |directive| to |policy|'s <a>directive set</a>.

  3.  Return |policy|.

  <h4 id="parse-serialized-policy-list" algorithm>
    Parse a serialized policy list
  </h4>

  Given a string (|list|) which contains a comma-delimited series of
  <a>serialized policies</a>, the following algorithm will return a list of
  <a>policies</a>:

  1.  Let |policies| be an empty list.

  2.  For each |token| returned by
      <a lt="split a string on commas">splitting |list| on commas</a>:

      1.  Let |policy| be the result of executing
          [[#parse-serialized-policy]] on |token|.

      2.  If |policy|'s <a>directive set</a> is empty, skip the
          remaining substeps, and continue to the next item.

      3.  Add |policy| to |policies|.

  3.  Return |policies|.

  <h3 id="framework-directives">Directives</h3>

  <a>Policies</a> contain a set of <dfn>directives</dfn>, each of which controls
  a specific behavior. The directives defined in this document are described in
  detail in [[#csp-directives]].

  Each <a>directive</a> is a <dfn for="directive">name</dfn> /
  <dfn for="directive">value</dfn> pair. The <a for="directive">name</a> is a
  non-empty string, and the <a>value</a> is a set of non-empty strings. The
  <a>value</a> set MAY be empty.

  A <dfn>serialized directive</dfn> is an ASCII string, consisting of one or more
  whitespace-delimited tokens, and adhering to the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    <dfn>serialized-directive</dfn> = <a>directive-name</a> [ <a>RWS</a> <a>directive-value</a> ]
    <dfn>directive-name</dfn>       = 1*( <a>ALPHA</a> / <a>DIGIT</a> / "-" )
    <dfn>directive-value</dfn>      = *( %x09 / %x20-%x2B / %x2D-%x3A / %x3C-%7E )
                           ; Directive values may contain whitespace and <a>VCHAR</a> characters,
                           ; excluding ";" and ","

    ; <a>RWS</a> is defined in section 3.2.3 of RFC7230. <a>ALPHA</a>, <a>DIGIT</a>, and
    ; <a>VCHAR</a> are defined in Appendix B.1 of RFC 5234.
  </pre>

  <h4 id="framework-directive-source-list">Source Lists</h4>

  Many <a>directives</a>' <a>values</a> consist of <dfn>source lists</dfn>: sets
  of tokens which identify content that can be fetched and potentially embedded
  or executed. These tokens represent one of the following types of <dfn>source
  expression</dfn>:

  1.  Keywords such as <a grammar>`'none'`</a> and
      <a grammar>`'self'`</a> (which match nothing and the current
      URL's origin, respectively)

  2.  Serialized URLs such as `https://example.com/path/to/file.js`
      (which matches a specific file) or `https://example.com/`
      (which matches everything on that origin)

  3.  Schemes such as `https:` (which matches any resource having
      the specified scheme)

  4.  Hosts such as `example.com` (which matches any resource on
      the host, regardless of scheme) or `*.example.com` (which
      matches any resource on the host or any of its subdomains (and any of
      its subdomains' subdomains, and so on))

  5.  Nonces such as `'nonce-qwertyu12345'` (which can match specific
      elements on a page)

  6.  Digests such as `'sha256-abcd...'` (which can match specific
      elements on a page)

  A <dfn>serialized source list</dfn> is an ASCII string, consisting of a
  space-delimited series of <a>source expressions</a>, adhering to the
  following ABNF grammar [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    <dfn>serialized-source-list</dfn> = ( <a>source-expression</a> *( <a>RWS</a> <a>source-expression</a> ) ) / "<dfn>'none'</dfn>"
    <dfn>source-expression</dfn>      = <a>scheme-source</a> / <a>host-source</a> / <a>keyword-source</a>
                             / <a>nonce-source</a> / <a>hash-source</a>

    ; Schemes:
    <dfn>scheme-source</dfn> = <a>scheme</a> ":"
                    ; <a>scheme</a> is defined in section 3.1 of RFC 3986.

  <h2 id="policy-delivery">
    Policy Delivery
  </h2>

  A server MAY declare a <a>policy</a> for a particular <a>resource
  representation</a> via an HTTP response header field whose value is a
  <a>serialized policy</a>. This mechanism is defined in detail in
  [[#csp-header]] and [[#cspro-header]], and the integration with Fetch
  and HTML is described in [[#fetch-integration]] and [[#html-integration]].

  A <a>policy</a> may also be declared inline in an HTML document via a
  <{meta}> element's <{meta/http-equiv}> attribute, as described in
  [[#meta-element]].

  <h3 id="csp-header">
    The `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP Response Header Field
  </h3>

  The <dfn>`Content-Security-Policy`</dfn> HTTP response header field
  is the preferred mechanism for delivering a policy from a server to a client.
  The header's value is represented by the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Content-Security-Policy = 1#<a grammar>serialized-policy</a>
  </pre>

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src 'self';
                               reports /csp-reporting-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  A server MAY send different `Content-Security-Policy` header field
  values with different <a>representations</a> of the same resource.

  A server SHOULD NOT send more than one HTTP response header field named
  "`Content-Security-Policy`" with a given <a>resource
  representation</a>.

  When the user agent receives a `Content-Security-Policy` header field, it
  MUST <a lt="parse a serialized policy">parse</a> and <a>enforce</a> each
  <a>serialized policy</a> it contains as described in [[#fetch-integration]],
  [[#html-integration]].

  <h3 id="cspro-header">
    The `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` HTTP Response Header Field
  </h3>

  The <dfn>`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`</dfn> HTTP response
  header field allows web developers to experiment with policies by monitoring
  (but not enforcing) their effects. The header's value is represented by the
  following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

  <pre>
    Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only = 1#<a grammar>serialized-policy</a>
  </pre>

  This header field allows developers to piece together their security policy in
  an iterative fashion, deploying a report-only policy based on their best
  estimate of how their site behaves, watching for violation reports, and then
  moving to an enforced policy once they've gained confidence in that behavior.

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>: script-src 'self';
                                           reports /csp-reporting-endpoint
    </pre>
  </div>

  A server MAY send different `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`
  header field values with different <a>representations</a> of the same
  resource.

  A server SHOULD NOT send more than one HTTP response header field named
  "`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`" with a given <a>resource
  representation</a>.

  When the user agent receives a `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header
  field, it MUST <a lt="parse a serialized policy">parse</a> and <a>monitor</a>
  each <a>serialized policy</a> it contains as described in
  [[#fetch-integration]] and [[#html-integration]].

  Note: The `<a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>` header is
  <strong>not</strong> supported inside a <{meta}> element.

  <h3 id="meta-element">
    The `<meta>` element
  </h3>

  A {{Document}} may deliver a policy via one or more HTML <{meta}> elements
  whose <{meta/http-equiv}> attributes are an <a>ASCII case-insensitive
  match</a> for the string "`Content-Security-Policy`". For example:

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self'"&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  Implementation details can be found in HTML's <a>`Content-Security-Policy`
  `http-equiv` processing instructions</a> [[!HTML]].

  Note: The `<a>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</a>` header is <em>not</em>
  supported inside a <{meta}> element. Neither are the `report-uri`,
  `frame-ancestors`, and `sandbox` directives.

  ISSUE: Why `sandbox`? Can we loosen that?

  Authors are <em>strongly encouraged</em> to place <{meta}> elements as early
  in the document as possible, because policies in <{meta}> elements are not
  applied to content which precedes them. In particular, note that resources
  fetched or prefetched using the `Link` HTTP response header
  field, and resources fetched or prefetched using <{link}> and <{script}>
  elements which precede a <{meta}>-delivered policy will not be blocked.

  Note: A policy specified via a <{meta}> element will be enforced along with
  any other policies active for the protected resource, regardless
  of where they're specified. The general impact of enforcing multiple
  policies is described in [[#multiple-policies]].

  Note: Modifications to the <{meta/content}> attribute of a <{meta}> element
  after the element has been parsed will be ignored.

<section>
  <h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This document defines a set of algorithms which are used in other
  specifications in order to implement the functionality. These
  integrations are outlined here for clarity, but those external
  documents are the normative references which ought to be consulted for
  detailed information.

  <h3 id="fetch-integration">
    Integration with Fetch
  </h3>

  A number of <a>directives</a> control resource loading in one way or
  another. This specification provides algorithms which allow Fetch to make
  decisions about whether or not a particular <a>request</a> should be blocked
  or allowed, and about whether a particular <a>response</a> should be replaced
  with a <a>network error</a>.

  1.  [[#should-block-request]] is called as part of step #4 of its <a>Main
      Fetch</a> algorithm.

  2.  [[#should-block-response]] is called as part of step #12 of its <a>Main
      Fetch</a> algorithm.

      Note: The <a>`frame-ancestors`</a> check is handled here, inside
      [[#should-block-response]].

  A <a>policy</a> is generally enforced upon a <a>global object</a>, but the
  user agent needs to <a lt="parse a serialized policy">parse</a> any policy
  delivered via an HTTP response header field before any <a>global object</a>
  is created in order to handle directives like <a>frame-ancestors</a>. To
  that end:
  
  1.  A <a>response</a> has an associated <a for="response">CSP list</a> which
      contains any policy objects delivered in the <a>response</a>'s
      <a for="response">header list</a>.

  2.  [[#set-response-csp-list]] is called in the <a>HTTP fetch</a> and
      <a>HTTP-network fetch</a> algorithms.

      Note: These two calls should ensure that a <a>response</a>'s
      <a for="response">CSP list</a> is set, regardless of how the
      <a>response</a> is created. If we hit the network (via <a>HTTP-network
      fetch</a>, then we parse the policy before we handle the `Set-Cookie`
      header. If we get a response from a Service Worker (via <a>HTTP fetch</a>,
      we'll process its <a for="response">CSP list</a> before handing the
      response back to our caller.

  <h4 id="set-response-csp-list" algorithm>

  </h4>

  Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm evaluates its
  <a for="response">header list</a> for <a>serialized policy</a> values, and
  populates its <a for="response">csp list</a> accordingly:

  1.  Set |response|'s <a for="response">CSP list</a> to the
      empty list.

  2.  Let |policies to enforce| be the result of executing
      [[#parse-serialized-policy-list]] on the result of
      <a lt="parse a header value">parsing</a> `Content-Security-Policy`
      in |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a>.

  3.  For each |policy| in |policies to enforce|:

      1.  Set |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> to
          "`enforce`".

      2.  Insert |policy| into |response|'s
          <a for="response">csp list</a>.

  4.  Let |policies to report| be the result of executing
      [[#parse-serialized-policy-list]] on the result of
      <a lt="parse a header value">parsing</a>

      5.  Execute [[#report-violation]] on the result of executing

      3.  If |document| has an <a>opener browsing context</a>, then add its
          <a>active document</a> to |documents|.

      4.  For each |doc| in |documents|:

          1.  For each |policy| in |doc|'s <a for="document">CSP list</a>:

              1.  Insert an alias to |policy| in |document|'s
                  <a for="document">CSP list</a>.

      Note: <a>local scheme</a> includes `about:`, and this algorithm will
      therefore alias the <a>embedding document</a>'s policies for <a>an iframe
      `srcdoc` `Document`</a>.

      Note: We do all this to ensure that a page cannot bypass its <a>policy</a>
      by embedding a frame or popping up a new window containing content it
      controls (`blob:` resources, or `document.write()`).

  2.  For each |policy| in |response|'s <a for="response">CSP list</a>, insert
      |policy| into |document|'s <a for="document">CSP list</a>.

  3.  Execute [[#directive-sandbox-apply]] on |document|.

  <h4 id="initialise-global-object-csp" algorithm>
    Initialise a global object's `CSP list`
  </h4>

  Given a <a>global object</a> (|global|), and a <a>response</a>
  (|response|), the user agent performs the following steps in order
  to initialize |global|'s <a for="global object">CSP list</a>:

  1.  If |response|'s <a for="response">url</a>'s {{URL/scheme}} is a
      <a>local scheme</a>:

      1.  Let |documents| be an empty list.

      2.  Add each of |global|'s
          <a lt="the worker's documents">document</a>s to |documents|.

      4.  For each |document| in |documents|:

          1.  For each |policy| in |document|'s <a>global
              object</a>'s <a for="global object">csp list</a>:

              1.  Insert an alias to |policy| in |global|'s
                  <a for="global object">csp list</a>.

      Note: <a>local scheme</a> includes `about:`, and this algorithm will
      therefore alias the <a>embedding document</a>'s policies for <a>an iframe
      `srcdoc` `Document`</a>.

  2.  For each |policy| in |response|'s
      <a for="response">csp list</a>, insert |policy| into
      |global|'s <a for="global object">csp list</a>.

  <h4 id="should-block-inline" algorithm>
    Should |element|'s inline behavior be blocked by Content Security Policy?
  </h4>

  Given an {{Element}} (|element|), this algorithm returns "`Allowed`" if the
  element is allowed to have inline definition of behavior (script execution,
  style application, event handlers, etc.), and "`Blocked`" otherwise:

  1.  Let |result| be "`Allowed`".

  2.  For each |policy| in |element|'s {{Document}}'s <a>global object</a>'s
      <a for="global object">CSP list</a>:

      1.  If [[#match-element-to-policy]] returns "`Does Not Match`" when
          executed upon |element| and |policy|, set |result| to "`Blocked`".

  2.  Return |result|.

  <a for="violation">global object</a>.

  1.  <a>Fire</a> a <a>trusted</a> event with the name `securitypolicyviolation`

      Note: Both {{SecurityPolicyViolationEvent/effectiveDirective}} and

      This is intentional to maintain backwards compatibility.

  2.  If |violation|'s <a for="violation">policy</a>'s <a for="policy">directive

      2.  If |endpoint| is not a valid URL, abort this algorithm.

      4.  <a>Fetch</a> |request|. The result will be ignored.

      Note: All of this should be considered deprecated. It sends a single
      request per violation, which simply isn't scalable. As soon as this
      behavior can be removed from user agents, it will be.

  3.  Do some better reporting.

<!-- Big Text: Directives -->
<section>
  <h2 id="csp-directives">
    Content Security Policy Directives
  </h2>
  
  This specification defines a number of types of <a>directives</a> which allow
  developers to control certain aspects of their sites' behavior. The defined
  directives fall into one of several categories:


  2.  ...

  To mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting attacks, web developers SHOULD
  include directives that regulate sources of script and plugins. They can do
  so by including:

  *   Both the <a>script-src</a> and <a>object-src</a> directives, or
  *   a <a>default-src</a> directive

  In either case, developers SHOULD NOT include either
  <a grammar>`'unsafe-inline'`</a>, or `data:` as valid
  sources in their policies. Both enable XSS attacks by allowing code to be
  included directly in the document itself; they are best avoided completely.

  <h3 id="directives-fetch">
    Fetch Directives
  </h3>
  
  <dfn>Fetch directives</dfn> control the locations from which certain resource
  types may be loaded. For instance, <a>script-src</a> allows developers to
  whitelist trusted sources of script to execute on a page, while
  <a>font-src</a> controls the sources of web fonts.

  <h4 id="directive-child-src">`child-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>child-src</dfn> directive governs the creation of <a>nested browsing
  contexts</a> and Worker execution contexts. The syntax for the directive's
  name and value is described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "child-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  This directive controls <a>requests</a> which will populate a frame or a
  worker. More formally, <a>requests</a> falling into one of the
  following categories:
  
  *  <a for="request">destination</a> is "`document`", and whose
     <a for="request">target browsing context</a> is a <a>nested browsing
     context</a> (e.g. requests which will populate an <{iframe}> or <{frame}>
     element)
     
  *  <a for="request">destination</a> is either "`serviceworker`",
     "`sharedworker`", or "`worker`" (which are fed to the <a>run a worker</a>
     algorithm for {{ServiceWorker}}, {{SharedWorker}}, and {{Worker}},
     respectively).

  <div class="example">
    Given a page with the following Content Security Policy:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>child-src</a> https://example.com/
    </pre>

    Fetches for the following code will all return network errors, as the URLs
    provided do not match `child-src`'s <a>source list</a>:

    <pre>
      &lt;iframe src="https://not-example.com"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
        var blockedWorker = new Worker("data:application/javascript,...");
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="directive-connect-src">`connect-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>connect-src</dfn> directive restricts the URLs which can be loaded
  using script interfaces. The syntax for the directive's name and value is
  described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "connect-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  This directive controls <a>requests</a> which transmit or receive data from
  other origins. More formally, <a>requests</a> falling into one of the
  following categories [[FETCH]]: 
 
  *   <a for="request">initiator</a> is "`fetch`" (e.g. `fetch()`)
  *   <a for="request">type</a> is "", and whose
      <a for="request">destination</a> is "`subresource`". (e.g. [[XHR]],
      [[EVENTSOURCE]], <{a}>'s <{a/ping}>, and [[BEACON]]

  This directive <em>also</em> controls WebSocket [[WEBSOCKETS]] connections,
  though those aren't technically part of Fetch.  

  <div class="example">
    JavaScript offers a few mechanisms that directly connect to an external
    server to send or receive information. `EventSource` maintains an open
    HTTP connection to a server in order to receive push notifications,
    `WebSockets` open a bidirectional communication channel between your
    browser and a server, and `XMLHttpRequest` makes arbitrary HTTP requests
    on your behalf. These are powerful APIs that enable useful functionality,
    but also provide tempting avenues for data exfiltration.

    The `connect-src` directive allows you to ensure that these and similar
    sorts of connections are only opened to origins you trust. Sending a
    policy that defines a list of source expressions for this directive is
    straightforward. For example, to limit connections to only
    `https://example.com`, send the following header:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>connect-src</a> https://example.com/
    </pre>

    Fetches for the following code will all return network errors, as the URLs
    provided do not match `connect-src`'s <a>source list</a>:

    <pre>
      &lt;a ping="https://not-example.com"&gt;...
      &lt;script&gt;
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open('GET', 'https://not-example.com/');
        xhr.send();

        var ws = new WebSocket("https://not-example.com/");
        
        var es = new EventSource("https://not-example.com/");

        navigator.sendBeacon("https://not-example.com/", { ... });
      &gt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="directive-default-src">`default-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>default-src</dfn> directive serves as a fallback for the other 
  <a>fetch directives</a>. The syntax for the directive's name and value is described by
  the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "default-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  If a <a>default-src</a> directive is present, its value will be used as the
  <a>effective source list</a> for any <a>fetch directive</a> which is not
  explicitly present in the policy.

  That is, given `default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'`, script requests will
  use `'self'` as the <a>effective source list</a> to match against. Other
  requests will use `'none'`. This is spelled out in more detail in the
  [[#match-request-to-policy]] algorithm.

  <div class="example">
    The following header:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>default-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
    </pre>

    will have the same behavior as the following header:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>child-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>connect-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>font-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>img-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>media-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>object-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>script-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>style-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
    </pre>

    That is, when `default-src` is set, every <a>fetch directive</a> that isn't
    explicitly set will fall back to the value `default-src` specifies.
  </div>
  <div class="example">
    There is no inheritance. If a `script-src` directive is explicitly
    specified, for example, then the value of `default-src` has no influence on
    script requests. That is, the following header:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>default-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>, <a>script-src</a> https://example.com
    </pre>

    will have the same behavior as the following header:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>child-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>connect-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>font-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>img-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>media-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>object-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
                               <a>script-src</a> https://example.com
                               <a>style-src</a> <a grammar>'self'</a>
    </pre>

    Given this behavior, one good way to build a policy for a site would be to
    begin with a `default-src` of `'none'`, and to build up a policy from there
    which allowed only those resource types which are necessary for the
    particular page the policy will apply to.
  </div>

  <h4 id="directive-font-src">`font-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>font-src</dfn> directive restricts the URLs from which font resources
  may be loaded. The syntax for the directive's name and value is described by
  the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "font-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  This directive controls <a>requests</a> which load fonts. More formally, this
  includes <a>requests</a> whose <a for="request">type</a> is "`font`"
  [[FETCH]].

  <div class="example">
    Given a page with the following Content Security Policy:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>font-src</a> https://example.com/
    </pre>

    Fetches for the following code will return a network errors, as the URL
    provided do not match `font-src`'s <a>source list</a>:

    <pre>
      &lt;style&gt;
        @font-face {
          font-family: "Example Font";
          src: url("https://not-example.com/font");
        }
        body {
          font-family: "Example Font";
        }
      &lt;/style&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="directive-img-src">`img-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>img-src</dfn> directive restricts the URLs from which image resources
  may be loaded. The syntax for the directive's name and value is described by
  the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "img-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  This directive controls <a>requests</a> which load images. More formally, this
  includes <a>requests</a> whose <a for="request">type</a> is "`image`"
  [[FETCH]].

  <div class="example">
    Given a page with the following Content Security Policy:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>img-src</a> https://example.com/
    </pre>

    Fetches for the following code will return a network errors, as the URL
    provided do not match `img-src`'s <a>source list</a>:

    <pre>
      &lt;img src="https://not-example.com/img"&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="directive-media-src">`media-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>media-src</dfn> directive restricts the URLs from which video, audio,
  and associated text track resources may be loaded. The syntax for the
  directive's name and value is described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "media-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  This directive controls <a>requests</a> which load images. More formally, this
  includes <a>requests</a> whose <a for="request">type</a> is "`track`",
  "`video`", or "`audio`" [[FETCH]].

  <div class="example">
    Given a page with the following Content Security Policy:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>media-src</a> https://example.com/
    </pre>

    Fetches for the following code will return a network errors, as the URL
    provided do not match `media-src`'s <a>source list</a>:

    <pre>
      &lt;audio src="https://not-example.com/audio"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
      &lt;video src="https://not-example.com/video"&gt;
          &lt;track kind="subtitles" src="https://not-example.com/subtitles"&gt;
      &lt;/video&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="directive-object-src">`object-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>object-src</dfn> directive restricts the URLs from which plugins may
  be loaded. The syntax for the directive's name and value is described by the
  following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "object-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  This directive controls <a>requests</a> which load plugin content. More
  formally, this includes <a>requests</a> whose
  <a for="request">destination</a> is "`unknown`" [[FETCH]].

  <div class="example">
    Given a page with the following Content Security Policy:

    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: <a>object-src</a> https://example.com/
    </pre>

    Fetches for the following code will return a network errors, as the URL
    provided do not match `object-src`'s <a>source list</a>:

    <pre>
      &lt;embed src="https://not-example.com/flash"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;
      &lt;object data="https://not-example.com/flash"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
      &lt;applet archive="https://not-example.com/flash"&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  If plugin content is loaded without an associated URL (perhaps an <{object}>
  element lacks a <{object/data}> attribute, but loads some default plugin based
  on the specified `type`), it MUST be blocked if `object-src`'s value is
  `'none'`, but will otherwise be allowed. The <a>`plugin-types`</a> directive
  can be used to control these kinds of plugins with more granularity.

  Note: The `object-src` directive acts upon any request made on behalf of
  an <{object}>, <{embed}>, or <{applet}> element. This includes requests
  which would populate the <a>nested browsing context</a> generated by the
  former two (also including navigations). This is true even when the data is
  semantically equivalent to content which would otherwise be restricted by
  another directive, such as an <{object}> element with a `text/html` MIME
  type.

  <h4 id="directive-script-src">`script-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>script-src</dfn> directive restricts the locations from which scripts
  may be executed. This includes not only URLs loaded directly into <{script}>
  elements, but also things like inline script blocks and XSLT stylesheets
  [[XSLT]] which can trigger script execution. The syntax for the directive's
  name and value is described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "script-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  The `script-src` directive governs four things:
  
  1.  Script <a>requests</a> MUST pass through [[#should-block-request]].
  2.  Script <a>responses</a> MUST pass through [[#should-block-response]].
  3.  Inline <{script}> blocks MUST pass through [[#should-block-inline]]. Their
      behavior will be blocked unless every policy allows inline script, either
      implicitly by not specifying a `script-src` (or `default-src`) directive,
      or explicitly, by whitelisting "`unsafe-inline`", a
      <a grammar>nonce-source</a> or a <a grammar>hash-source</a> that matches
      the inline block.
  4.  The following JavaScript execution sinks are gated on the "`unsafe-eval`"
      source expression:

      *   {{eval()}}
      *   {{Function()}}
      *   {{setTimeout()}} with an initial argument which is not callable.
      *   {{setInterval()}} with an initial argument which is not callable.

      Note: If a user agent implements non-standard sinks like `setImmediate()`
      or `execScript()`, they SHOULD also be gated on "`unsafe-eval`".

  <h4 id="directive-style-src">`style-src`</h4>

  The <dfn>style-src</dfn> directive restricts the locations from which style
  may be applied to a {{Document}}. The syntax for the directive's name and
  value is described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "style-src"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  The `style-src` directive governs several things:

  1.  Style <a>requests</a> MUST pass through [[#should-block-request]]. This
      includes:

      1.  Stylesheet requests originating from a <{link}> element.
      2.  Stylesheet requests originating from the <a at-rule>`@import`</a>
          rule.
      3.  Stylesheet requests originating from a `Link` HTTP response header
          field [[!RFC5988]].
  
  2.  <a>Responses</a> to style requests MUST pass through
      [[#should-block-response]].

  3.  Inline <{style}> blocks MUST pass through [[#should-block-inline]]. The
      styles will be blocked unless every policy allows inline style, either
      implicitly by not specifying a `script-src` (or `default-src`) directive,
      or explicitly, by whitelisting "`unsafe-inline`", a
      <a grammar>nonce-source</a> or a <a grammar>hash-source</a> that matches
      the inline block.

  4.  The following CSS algorithms are gated on the `unsafe-eval` source
      expression:

      1.  <a>insert a CSS rule</a>
      2.  <a>parse a CSS rule</a>,
      3.  <a>parse a CSS declaration block</a>
      4.  <a>parse a group of selectors</a>

      This would include, for example, all invocations of CSSOM's various
      <code>cssText</code> setters and <code>insertRule</code> methods
      [[!CSSOM]] [[!HTML5]].

      ISSUE: This needs to be better explained.

  <h4 id="fetch-directive-matching-url">URL Matching Algorithms</h4>

  <h5 id="match-request-to-policy" algorithm>
    Does |request| match |policy|?
  </h5>

  1.  Let |source list| be the result of executing
      [[#effective-source-list-for-request]] on |request| and |policy|.

  2.  Return the result of executing [[#match-url-to-source-list]] on
      |request|'s <a for="request">url</a> and |source list|.

  <h5 id="match-url-to-source-list" algorithm>
    Does |url| match |source list|?
  </h5>

  Given a {{URL}} (|url|), and a <a>source list</a> (|source list|), this
  algorithm returns "`Matches`" if the URL matches one or more source
  expressions in |source list|, or "`Does Not Match`" otherwise:

  1.  If |source list| is `null`, return "`Matches`".

  2.  If |source list| contains a single item which is a <a>case-sensitive</a>
      match for the string "`'none'`", return `Does Not Match`.

  3.  For each |expression| in |source list|:

      1.  If [[#match-url-to-source-expression]] returns "`Matches`" when
          executed upon |url| and |expression|, return "`Matches`".

  4.  Return "`Does Not Match`".

  <h5 id="match-url-to-source-expression" algorithm>
    Does |url| match |expression| in |origin| with |redirect count|?
  </h5>

  Given a {{URL}} (|url|), a <a>source expression</a> (|expression|), an
  <a>origin</a> (|origin|), and a number (|redirect count|), this algorithm
  returns "`Matches`" if |url| matches |expression|, and "`Does Not Match`"
  otherwise.

  Note: |origin| is the <a>origin</a> of the resource relative to which the
  |expression| should be resolved. "`'self'`", for instance, will have distinct
  meaning depending on that bit of context.

  1.  If |expression| is the string "*", and |url|'s {{URL/scheme}} is not a
      <a>local scheme</a>, return "`Matches`".
      
  2.  If |expression| matches the <a grammar>`scheme-source`</a> grammar
      that is not an <a>ASCII case-insensitive match</a> for |url|'s {{URL/scheme}},
      then return "`Does Not Match`" unless one of the following conditions is
      met:
      1.  |expression|'s <a grammar>`scheme-source`</a> is an <a>ASCII
          case-insensitive match</a> for "`http:`" and |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}
          is "`https`"
              
      2.  |expression|'s <a grammar>`scheme-source`</a> is an <a>ASCII
          case-insensitive match</a> for "`ws:`" and |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}
          is "`wss`"
              
  Note: This makes `script-src http:` semantically equivalent to `script-src http: https:`
  and `script-src ws:` semantically equivalent to `script-src wss:`, among others.
  A secure upgrade is always allowed from an explicitly insecure expression.

  3.  If |expression| matches the <a grammar>`host-source`</a> grammar:

      1.  If |expression| has a <a grammar>`scheme-part`</a> that is not an
          <a>ASCII case-insensitive match</a> for |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}, then
          return "`Does Not Match`" unless one of the following conditions is
          met:
         
          1.  |expression|'s <a grammar>`scheme-part`</a> is an <a>ASCII
              case-insensitive match</a> for "`http`" and |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}
              is "`https`"
              
          2.  |expression|'s <a grammar>`scheme-part`</a> is an <a>ASCII
              case-insensitive match</a> for "`ws`" and |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}
              is "`wss`"

      2.  If |url|'s {{URL/host}} is missing, return "`Does Not Match`".

      3.  If |expression| does not have a <a grammar>`scheme-part`</a>, then
          return "`Does Not Match`" unless one of the following conditions is
          met:

          1.  |origin|'s {{URL/scheme}} is |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}

          2.  |origin|'s {{URL/scheme}} is "`http`", and |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}
              one of "`https`", "`ws`", or "`wss`".

          3.  |origin|'s {{URL/scheme}} is "`https`", and |url|'s {{URL/scheme}}
              is "`wss`".

          Note: As with <a grammar>`scheme-part`</a> above, we allow schemeless
          <a grammar>`host-source`</a> expressions to be upgraded from insecure
          schemes to secure schemes.
      
      3.  If the first character of |expression|'s <a grammar>`host-part`</a>
          is an U+002A ASTERISK character (`*`):
          
          1.  Let |remaining| be the result of removing the leading "`*`" from
              |expression|.

          2.  If |remaining| (including the leading U+002E FULL STOP character
              (`.`)) is not an <a>ASCII case-insensitive match</a> for the
              rightmost characters of |url|'s {{URL/host}}, then return "`Does
              Not Match`".

      4.  If the first character of |expression|'s <a grammar>`host-part`</a>
          is not an U+002A ASTERISK character (`*`), and |url|'s {{URL/host}}
          is not an <a>ASCII case-insensitive match</a> for |expression|'s
          <a grammar>`host-part`</a>, return "`Does Not Match`".

      5.  If |expression|'s <a grammar>`host-part`</a> matches the
          <a grammar>IPv4address</a> rule from [[!RFC3986]], and is not
          "`127.0.0.1`"; or if |expression|'s <a grammar>`host-part`</a> is an
          <a>IPv6 address</a>, return "`Does Not Match`".

          Note: A future version of this specification may allow literal IPv6
          and IPv4 addresses, depending on usage and demand. Given the weak
          security properties of IP addresses in relation to named hosts,
          however, authors are encouraged to prefer the latter whenever
          possible.

      6.  If |expression| does not contain a <a grammar>`port-part`</a>, and
          |url|'s {{URL/port}} is not the <a>default port</a> for |url|'s
          {{URL/scheme}}, return "`Does Not Match`".

      7.  If |expression| does contain a <a grammar>`port-part`</a>:

          1.  If |expression|'s <a grammar>`port-part`</a> is not "`*`", and
              is not the same number as |url|'s {{URL/port}}, return "`Does Not
              Match`".

      8.  If |expression| contains a non-empty <a grammar>`path-part`</a>, and
          |redirect count| is 0, then:

          1.  Let |exact match| be `false` if the final character of
              |expression|'s <a grammar>`path-part`</a> is the U+002F SOLIDUS
              character (`/`), and `true` otherwise.

          2.  Let |path list| be the result of
              <a lt="strictly split a string">strictly splitting</a>
              |expression|'s <a grammar>`path-part`</a> on the U+002F SOLIDUS
              character (`/`).

          3.  If |path list| has more items than |url|'s {{URL/path}}, return
              "`Does Not Match`".

          4.  If |exact match| is `true`, and |path list| does not have the same
              number of items as |url|'s {{URL/path}}, return "`Does Not
              Match`".

          5.  For each |expression piece| in |path list|:

              1.  Let |url piece| be the next item in |url|'s {{URL/path}}.

              2.  <a>Percent decode</a> |expression piece|.

              3.  <a>Percent decode</a> |url piece|.

              4.  If |expression piece| is not an <a>ASCII case-insensitive
                  match</a> for |url piece|, return "`Does Not Match`".

      9. Return "`Matches`".

      Note: This makes `script-src http://example.com/` semantically
      equivalent to `script-src http://example.com https://example.com`,
      and `script-src ws://example.com/` semantically equivalent to
      `script-src ws://example.com wss://example.com`, among others.
      A secure upgrade is always allowed from an explicitly insecure expression.

  4.  If |expression| is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive match</a> for "`'self'`",
      return "`Matches`" if one or more of the following conditions is met:

      1.  |origin| is the same as |url|'s {{URL/origin}}

      2.  |origin|'s {{URL/host}} is the same as |url|'s {{URL/host}},
          |origin|'s {{URL/port}} and |url|'s {{URL/port} are either the same
          or the <a>default ports</a> for their respective {{URL/scheme}}s, and
          one or more of the following conditions is met:
          
          1.  |url|'s {{URL/scheme}} is "`https`" or "`wss`"
          2.  |origin|'s {{URL/scheme}} is "`http`"

      Note: Like the <a grammar>`scheme-part`</a> logic above, the "`'self'`"
      matching algorithm allows upgrades to secure schemes when it is safe to do
      so. We limit these upgrades to endpoints running on the default port for a
      particular scheme or a port that matches the origin of the protected
      resource, as this seems sufficient to deal with upgrades that can be
      reasonably expected to succeed.

  5.  Return "`Does Not Match`".

  <h4 id="directive-base-uri">`base-uri`</h4>

  The <dfn>base-uri</dfn> directive restricts the {{URL}}s which can be used in
  a {{Document}}'s <{base}> element. The syntax for the directive's name and
  value is described by the following ABNF:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "base-uri"
    directive-value = <a grammar>serialized-source-list</a>
  </pre>

  The following algorithm is called during HTML's <a>set the frozen base url</a>
  algorithm in order to monitor and enforce this directive:

  <h5 id="allow-base-for-document" algorithm>
    Is |base| allowed for |document|?
  </h5>

  Given a {{URL}} (|base|), and a {{Document}} (|document|), this algorithm
  returns "`Allowed`" if |base| may be used as the value of a <{base}>
  element's <{base/href}> attribute, and "`Blocked`" otherwise:

  1.  For each |policy| in |document|'s <a>global object</a>'s
      <a for="global object">csp list</a>:

      1.  Let |source list| be `null`.

      2.  If a <a>directive</a> whose <a for="directive">name</a> is
          "`base-uri`" is present in |policy|'s <a for="policy">directive
          set</a>, set |source list| to that <a>directive</a>'s
          <a for="directive">value</a>.

      3.  If |source list| is `null`, skip to the next |policy|.

      4.  If the result of executing [[#match-url-to-source-list]] on |base| and
          |source list| is "`Does Not Match`":
         
          1.  Let |violation| be the result of executing
              [[#create-violation-for-global]] on |document|'s <a>global
              object</a>, |policy|, and "<a>`base-uri`</a>".

          2.  Set |violation|'s <a for="violation">resource</a> to "`inline`".

          3.  Execute [[#report-violation]] on |violation|.
          
          4.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is "`enforce`",
              return "`Blocked`".

  2.  Return "`Allowed`".

  <h4 id="directive-form-action">`form-action`</h4>

  The <dfn>form-action</dfn> directive restricts the {{URL}}s which can be used
  as the target of a form submissions.

  ISSUE: Define the hooks into HTML's navigation and form submission algorithms.

  <h4 id="directive-frame-ancestors">`frame-ancestors`</h4>

  The <dfn>frame-ancestors</dfn> directive restricts the {{URL}}s which can
  embed the resource using <{frame}>, <{iframe}>, <{object}>, <{embed}>, or
  <{applet}> element. Resources can use this directive to avoid many UI
  Redressing [[UISECURITY]] attacks, by avoiding the risk of being embedded into
  potentially hostile contexts.

  The directive's syntax is described by the following ABNF grammar:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    directive-name  = "frame-ancestors"
    directive-value = <a>ancestor-source-list</a>

    <dfn>ancestor-source-list</dfn> = ( <a>ancestor-source</a> *( <a>RWS</a> <a>ancestor-source</a>) ) / "<a>'none'</a>"
    <dfn>ancestor-source</dfn>      = <a>scheme-source</a> / <a>host-source</a> / "<a>'self'</a>"
  </pre>

  The `frame-ancestors` directive is enforced as part of
  [[#should-block-response]].

  The `frame-ancestors` directive MUST be ignored when contained in a policy
  declared via a <{meta}> element.

  Note: The `frame-ancestors` directive's syntax is similar to a <a>source
  list</a>, but `frame-ancestors` will not fall back to the `default-src`
  directive's value if one is specified. That is, a policy that declares
  `default-src 'none'` will still allow the resource to be embedded by anyone.

  <h4 id="directive-plugin-types">`plugin-types`</h4>

  <dfn>plugin-types</dfn>

  <h4 id="directive-sandbox">`sandbox`</h4>

  The <dfn>sandbox</dfn> directive specifies an HTML sandbox policy which the
  user agent will apply to a resource, just as though it had been included in
  an <{iframe}> with a <{iframe/sandbox}> property.

  The directive's syntax is described by the following ABNF grammar:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    directive-name  = "sandbox"
    directive-value = "" / <a>token</a> *( <a>RWS</a> <a>token</a> )
  </pre>

  This directive has no reporting requirements; it will be ignored entirely when
  delivered in a <a>`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`</a> header, or within
  a <{meta}> element.

  <h5 id="directive-sandbox-apply" algorithm>
    Apply the `sandbox` directive to |document|
  </h5>

  Given a |document|, this algorithm adjusts its <a>forced sandboxing flag
  set</a> according to the <a>`sandbox`</a> values present in its policies.

  Note: This algorithm is executed during [[#initialise-global-object-csp]]
  (which is executed during HTML's <a>initialising a new `Document` object</a>
  algorithm).

  1.  For each |policy| in |document|'s <a>global object</a>'s
      <a for="global object">CSP list</a>:

      1.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">disposition</a> is not "`Enforce`", skip
          to the next |policy|.

      2.  If |policy|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> does not contain a
          <a>directive</a> (|directive|) whose <a for="directive">name</a> is
          "`sandbox`", skip to the next |policy|.

      3.  <a>Parse a sandboxing directive</a> using |directive|'s
          <a for="directive">value</a> as the input, and |document|'s <a>forced
          sandboxing flag set</a> as the output.

  <h4 id="directive-report-uri">`report-uri`</h4>

  Note: The <a>`report-uri`</a> directive is deprecated. Please use the
  <a>reports</a> directive instead.

  The <dfn>`report-uri`</dfn> directive defines a set of endpoints to which
  <a>violation reports</a> will be sent when particular behaviors are prevented.
  The directive has no effect in and of itself, but only gains meaning in

  Various algorithms in this document hook into the reporting process by
  constructing a <a>violation</a> object via [[#create-violation-for-request]]
  or [[#create-violation-for-global]], and passing that object to
  [[#report-violation]] to deliver the report.

  <h4 id="directive-report">`reports`</h4>

  The <dfn>reports</dfn> directive defines the endpoint to which violation
  reports are sent. The syntax for the directive's name and

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="security-nonces">Nonce Reuse</h3>

  Nonces override the other restrictions present in the directive in which
  they're delivered. It is critical, then, that they remain unguessable, as
  bypassing a resource's policy is otherwise trivial.

  If a server delivers a <a grammar>nonce-source</a> expression as part of a
  <a>policy</a>, the server MUST generate a unique value each time it
  transmits a policy. The generated value SHOULD be at least 128 bits long
  (before encoding), and SHOULD be generated via a cryptographically secure
  random number generator in order to ensure that the value is difficult for
  an attacker to predict.

  Note: Using a nonce to whitelist inline script or style is less secure than
  not using a nonce, as nonces override the restrictions in the directive in
  which they are present. An attacker who can gain access to the nonce can
  execute whatever script they like, whenever they like. That said, nonces
  provide a substantial improvement over <a grammar>'unsafe-inline'</a> when
  layering a content security policy on top of old code. When considering
  <a grammar>'unsafe-inline'</a>, authors are encouraged to consider nonces
  (or hashes) instead.

  <h3 id="multiple-policies">
    The effect of multiple policies
  </h3>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  The above sections note that when multiple policies are present, each must be
  enforced or reported, according to its type. An example will help clarify how
  that ought to work in practice. The behavior of an `XMLHttpRequest`
  might seem unclear given a site that, for whatever reason, delivered the
  following HTTP headers:

  <div class="example">
    <pre>
      Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' http://example.com http://example.net;
                               connect-src 'none';
      Content-Security-Policy: connect-src http://example.com/;
                               script-src http://example.com/
    </pre>
  </div>

  Is a connection to example.com allowed or not? The short answer is that the
  connection is not allowed. Enforcing both policies means that a potential
  connection would have to pass through both unscathed. Even though the second
  policy would allow this connection, the first policy contains
  `connect-src 'none'`, so its enforcement blocks the connection. The
  impact is that adding additional policies to the list of policies to enforce
  can <em>only</em> further restrict the capabilities of the protected resource.

  To demonstrate that further, consider a script tag on this page. The first
  policy would lock scripts down to `'self'`, `http://example.com` and
  `http://example.net` via the `default-src` directive. The second, however,
  would only allow script from `http://example.com/`. Script will only load if
  it meets both policy’s criteria: in this case, the only origin that can match
  is `http://example.com`, as both policies allow it.

  <h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="extensions">Vendor-specific Extensions and Addons</h3>

  <a>Policy</a> enforced on a resource SHOULD NOT interfere with the operation
  of user-agent features like addons, extensions, or bookmarklets. These kinds
  of features generally advance the user's priority over page authors, as
  espoused in [[HTML-DESIGN]].
  
  Moreover, applying CSP to these kinds of features produces a substantial
  amount of noise in violation reports, significantly reducing their value to
  developers.

  Chrome, for example, excludes the `chrome-extension:` scheme from CSP checks,
  and does some work to ensure that extension-driven injections are allowed,
  regardless of a page's policy.
